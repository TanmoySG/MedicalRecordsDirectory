# Medical Records Directory
A project to keep track of Medical History of an individual, to be used by Doctors and Medical Personel for better treatment of that individual.

### Deployed at [mld.tanmoysg.com](https://mld.tanmoysg.com)

The Project’s aim is to use an Individual’s Unique Identification Number (Aadhar, in case of India) for  the  purpose  of  keeping  records  of  the  medical  history  of  that  individual.  This  will  enable doctors  to  make  treatment  more  effective  and  eradicate  the  need  of  any  physical  records. Complete  medical  history  of  an  individual  helps  a  Doctor  to  understand  his/her  patient's previous  medical  conditions  and  its  effects  on  the  patient's  current  medical  condition  by assessment of the test reports and previously prescribed medications, without the need of any physical hard copy ofthe same. People  generally  tend  to  lose  or  throw  away  their  old  medical  history  considering  that  these would not be needed anymore. This system can help the medical system of the country by making data more accessible.
